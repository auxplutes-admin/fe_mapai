            <p className="text-white/70 text-sm mb-2">
              Kongo Central is the only province in the country with an ocean coastline, with a narrow frontage on the Atlantic Ocean to the west. It borders the city province of Kinshasa to the north-east, the province of Kwango to the east, and the Republic of Angola to the south and north.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/70 text-sm mb-2">
              The provincial capital is Matadi, a major port city on the Congo River, while Boma, the former capital, is another important urban center. Kongo Central covers an area of about 53,920 kmÂ² and has a population of over 5 million people, predominantly from the Bakongo ethnic group.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/70 text-sm mb-2">
              The province is rich in natural resources, including oil, limestone, and agricultural products such as cassava, bananas, and palm oil. Its strategic location makes it a vital gateway for trade, with the Matadi Bridge and the seaport facilitating much of the DRC's imports and exports.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white/70 text-sm">
              Kongo Central is also known for its cultural heritage, vibrant music, and historical sites, including the Cataracts of the Congo River and remnants of colonial architecture. The province plays a crucial role in the economic and cultural landscape of the DRC.
